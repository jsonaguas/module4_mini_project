In this project, you will apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python to develop an advanced Library Management System. This command-line-based application is designed to streamline the management of books and resources within a library. Your mission is to create a robust system that allows users to browse, borrow, return, and explore a collection of books while demonstrating your proficiency in OOP principles and the use of modules.

Enhanced User Interface (UI) and Menu:

Create an improved, user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Library Management System with separate menus for each class of the system.
    Welcome to the Library Management System!

    Main Menu:
    1. Book Operations
    2. User Operations
    3. Author Operations
    4. Quit
Book Operations:
        Book Operations:
        1. Add a new book
        2. Borrow a book
        3. Return a book
        4. Search for a book
        5. Display all books
User Operations:
        User Operations:
        1. Add a new user
        2. View user details
        3. Display all users
Author Operations:
        Author Operations:
        1. Add a new author
        2. View author details
        3. Display all authors
Class Structure:

Implement a class structure that represents key entities in the library management system, including:
Book: A class representing individual books with attributes such as title, author,  genre, publication date, and availability status.
User: A class to represent library users with attributes like name, library ID, and a list of borrowed book titles.
Author: A class representing book authors with attributes like name and biography.


Encapsulation:

Apply encapsulation principles by defining private attributes and using getters and setters for necessary data access.


Modules:

Organize your code into modules to promote code organization and maintainability. Create separate modules for classes, user interactions, and error handling.


Menu Actions:

Implement the following actions in response to menu selections using the classes you've created:


Adding a new book with all relevant details.
Allowing users to borrow a book, marking it as "Borrowed."
Allowing users to return a book, marking it as "Available."
Searching for a book by its unique identifier (title) and displaying its details.
Displaying a list of all books with their unique identifiers.
Adding a new user with user details.
Viewing user details.
Displaying a list of all users.
Adding a new author with author details.
Viewing author details.
Displaying a list of all authors.
Quitting the application.
